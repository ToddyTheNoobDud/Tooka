## Why?

This project is mostly a solo project one, i don't really pretend to make this a fr project (public usage, production, etc). But if it happens, i will maintain it :),

Everything on this repo is made from day-one, from scratch. Nodelink and lavalink will bases will be used as a **IDEIA** on how to make this compatible with public clients usage if happens.

This project is focused on personal use, so i may just do specific stuff for myself.
